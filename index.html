			<u>Flicker Tonic</u> is the debut collection from <u>TILT</u>, the joint practice of Lily Clark and Tristan Scow. The two designers share an interest in shaping meditative environments through objects that both produce and interact with light. <u>Flicker Tonic</u> relies on the viewer to complete each piece through careful, sustained looking. With the help of automated processes, the laser cut mobiles, lamps, and programmable blinds magnify subtle interactions between light and shadow. The inspiration for <u>Flicker Tonic</u> comes from a statement made by the Italian designer, Ettore Sottsass: "One very simple idea: to design a lamp means to design the environment - to design the environment means to favor consciousness.‚Äù
